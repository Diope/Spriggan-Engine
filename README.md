# Spriggan Engine

Fancy name for a basic renderer. So yea this is my C++ project I've been cranking away at for a while. It's a basic renderer utilizing DirectX 11.
It's fairly straightforward in implementation, an orthagonal camera with controls, basic texturing, and phong lighting is used.
I tried my best to implement very important components into this such as Swap Chain which I still don't fully understand but enough to add it.

Cherno project on Youtube was a big help in some of this stuff, StackOverflow as well, and can't forget Reddit, and books!

Note: Looks like I'll need to push all the branches via terminal/CMD as VS2017 doesn't support that?
